<h2><b>Steps Taken To Implement The App</b></h2>
First of all, all of us have a group meeting to discuss what we want to do in this project. We have discussed and list out the function that we are planning to do.
Then we decided to do the project using MIT App Inventor as it is easy and user-friendly to us. MIT App Inventor provides QR code for us to get access to the applications
which very convenient for us to test the application and determine the bugs. When the app is done, MIT App Inventor can also directly generate a apk file for android user
to install the application.
